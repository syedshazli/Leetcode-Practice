# Leetcode-Practice
Join me on my leetcode journey.

Notes for specific problems:

Invert Binary Tree: Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

*Notes on Problem
* My implementation is a Post Order Traversal of the Tree
* The implementation uses recursion to find the leaf nodes, which then return the parent node to allow swapping
* We switch the left and the right of the roots to ivnert the tree properly
