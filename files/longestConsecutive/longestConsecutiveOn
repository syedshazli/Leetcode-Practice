#O(n)
#Notes
# Did this problem alongside Eshaan. Got pretty close to figuring it out but needed some help
# First set all the values in nums to a hashmap. This sorts the hashmap and gets rid of duplicates
# For num in the hashmap, if the previous number exists, then we skip the iteration. Else, we found the beginning of the sequene. 
# Set j to 1 as we are at the beginning of the sequence
# While num + j is in consecutive, add 1 to j.
# This ensures that we only check for the next one. If it's not in consecutive, then j resets to 1 on the next iterations
# Find the max between maximum and j, return maximum

    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):

        #use get or default for hashmap?
        #first, how would we solve on >O(n)
            #sort the list, loop through, keep a count, if the next element is not 1 more then stop the count
            # I got that
        #but, we need to do O(n)
