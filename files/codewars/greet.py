#Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".
#[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

#Note to self, just making sure I stay active while on vacation lol
def greet(name):
    #Good Luck (like you need it)
    return("Hello, "+ name +" how are you doing today?")
pass
